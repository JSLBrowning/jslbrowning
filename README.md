I’m a PhD student at Auburn University, studying computer science and software engineering. My studies are currently focused on machine learning.

Chances are you’re here because of [that other thing](https://wallofhistory.com/ "JSLBrowning"), though. If you’re interested in looking at the code, you can do so [here](https://github.com/JSLBrowning/Wall-of-History), but be warned — it’s still kind of a mess down there.

If you’d like to contact me, my [email](mailto:james@wallofhistory.com) is your best bet.
